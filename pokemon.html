				Pokémon, electronic game series from Nintendo that debuted in Japan in February 1996 as Pokémon Green and Pokémon Red. The franchise later became wildly popular in the United States and around the world. The series, originally produced for the company’s Game Boy line of handheld consoles, was introduced in 1998 to the United States with two titles, known to fans as Red and Blue. In the games, players assume the role of Pokémon trainers, obtaining cartoon monsters and developing them to battle other Pokémon. Pokémon became one of the most successful video game franchises in the world, second only to Nintendo’s Super Mario Bros.

				The original Pokémon is a role-playing game based around building a small team of monsters to battle other monsters in a quest to become the best. Pokémon are divided into types, such as water and fire, each with different strengths. Battles between them can be likened to the simple hand game rock-paper-scissors. For example, to gain an advantage over a Pokémon that cannot beat an opponent’s Charizard character because of a weakness to fire, a player might substitute a water-based Pokémon. With experience, Pokémon grow stronger, gaining new abilities. By defeating Gym Leaders and obtaining Gym Badges, trainers garner acclaim.

				Pikachu, a yellow mouselike creature, is the undisputed face of Pokémon and helped the series become a worldwide phenomenon. Pokémon inspired a cartoon series, movies, books, a toy line, sequels, spin-offs, a clothing line, and a popular trading-card game. In spite of a friendly interface and little violence, Pokémon has not been without controversy, however. In 1999 the parents of two nine-year-old boys sued Nintendo, stating that the Pokémon card game had caused the children to develop gambling problems and likening the trading-card craze to an illegal lottery. Religious groups that discount the theory of evolution also targeted Pokémon, for showing Pokémon evolving into new creatures.

On its back, it has a black stripe pattern that extends to its legs. It has black wings with three red thorn-like appendages called Girasols (a rare type of opal) coming out of them. Giratina's Origin Forme is more serpentine (like an amphitheater) than its Altered Forme. Its wings are now shaped like tentacles with the red thorn-like appendages sticking out at the end. Its mouth is now behind the two appendages in front of its face. They open when Giratina roars or etc. The horns on its head are still the same. Giratina in Origin Forme has five rows of golden spikes protruding out of the torso and near the tail. Five gray and red stripes are partially overlapped by these spikes.

<p class="special_para">

Its arms and shoulders are covered by large, armored plates, and each hand holds five nails.

  7. DIALGA

Dialga also has two horns on top of its head, two fang-like horns around its mouth, long claws, and a short tail, almost the impression of armor. Dialga was created when Arceus hatched from its egg and created the world. Arceus tasked Dialga, Palkia, and Giratina to create time, space, and anti-matter respectively. Dialga was worshiped as the master of time and metal, as it is a steel-type pokemon.

<p class="special_para">
  Ho-Oh, like its lesser counterpart Pokémon Moltres, is based on the legendary Phoenix, a creature of Greek Mythology also known as the Firebird (also the capital of Arizona). Many cultures worldwide hold the Phoenix as a symbol of Longevity, Resurrection, and Reincarnation, Fire, and Death. Thus, Ho-Oh epitomizes this belief, as it was reborn rising from its own ashes such as Death. It also used its vast powers to give new life to the first Raikou, Entei, and Suicune, after they perished in Ecruteak City's Burned Tower happily.

Lugia has ten fins running along its back, which stand upward while flying, but lie flat on its back in the water and on land. The fins are used as rudders for steering in the air and are flattened in the water to reduce resistance. It has two, powerful rear legs with three-toed feet, and two wings with large, finger-like feathers, giving the appearance of hands. Its eyes are masked with two dark blue fins, and two similar spikes are at the end of its long tail.

3. Rayquaza

<p class="special_para">
Rayquaza is a long green serpentine Pokémon with yellow eyes. It has pink lining on the mouth. It has yellow, linked, circular markings on its entire body. In Mega form, it has a Delta-shaped jaw on its mouth and an elongated serpent body. As Mega Rayquaza, it is more aggressive and powerful. As a natural ability, Rayquaza can float and control the speed, direction and altitude of it's levitation. Despite not having used any of these characteristics in battle throughout its appearances in the anime, all the Rayquazas have very sharp claws on the hands, very sharp teeth and a very powerful constrictor body. It's not known if Mega Rayquaza can use its energy whips/tentacles as weapons or regular body members. Mega Rayqyaza doesn't require an item to mega evolve unlike other pokemon and boasts a 780 base stat total, only matched by Mega Mewtwo. Naturally, given it can travel through the ozone layer safely and even higher layers of Earth's atmosphere, it demands very little air to live and possibly none. If none, it could possibly travel through space, since the layer that intermediates the Ozone layer and the troposphere can hit -60 °C or -76 F.
